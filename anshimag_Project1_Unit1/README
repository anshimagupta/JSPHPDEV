The project can be directly imported into any IDE.
Run the driver class.
There are three packages:
Model
	- Automotive Class with inner classes
	- OptionSet class with inner class Option
Util
	-FileIO - to serialize and deserialize
	-ReadFile - to parse the file and count the options
Driver
	-Driver class to test the functionality

There is a test_output.txt file in the root folder.
The class diagram can also be found at the same place.


Design Decision

FileIO - The AutomotiveProperties.txt file has the name of the Ford Model along with the base price. Subsequent lines have each item from the OptionSet. I have used “:” to separate the optionSet. The options are separated by “;” and the price is assigned with “=“.

OptionSet1: Option1=value1; Option2=value2;
OptionSet2: Option1=value1; Option2=value2; Option3=value3
