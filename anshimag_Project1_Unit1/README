The project can be directly imported into any IDE.
Run the driver class.
There are three packages:
Model
	- Automotive Class with inner classes
	- OptionSet class with inner class Option
Util
	-FileIO - to serialize and deserialize
	-ReadFile - to parse the file and count the options
Driver
	-Driver class to test the functionality

There is a test_output.txt file in the root folder.
The class diagram can also be found at the same place.


Design Decision

FileIO - The AutomotiveProperties.txt file has the name of the Ford Model along with the base price. Subsequent lines have each item from the OptionSet. I have used “:” to separate the optionSet. The options are separated by “;” and the price is assigned with “=“.

OptionSet1: Option1=value1; Option2=value2;
OptionSet2: Option1=value1; Option2=value2; Option3=value3

The model package has classes to retrieve the model name and base price. Apart from this, the OptionSets and Options fields can be updated or deleted one at a time.

I have used hash map to store the OptionSet Name and option set. Another hash map is for the choice name and the choice object. This is necessary to query on name of Option Sets or options.
